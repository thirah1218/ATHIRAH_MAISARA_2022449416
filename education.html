    <td>‚ùÄ I went to SJK(C)Sin Ming from 2011 until 2016.<br> My parents want me to master chinese since I was younger <br> so that I get to communicate with other chinese people well <br> and understand them better. <br>‚ùÄ I learn that studying a new language not only the language itself, <br> but I also get to learn new and interesting culture that I never know nor learn about it. <br>‚ùÄ I also becoming more punctual on homework and be more discipline on time. <br>‚ùÄ Unfortunately, I somehow get bullied when I'm in standard 5 due to <br> starting wearing hijab and also because I'm a muslim. <br> Thankfully, I have my friends that backed me up even though we're not the same religion. <br>‚ùÄ For me, being in a chinese school is not a very easy since we have alot of pressure on <br> academics from the teachers and the school, even the rules are quite strict. But when I <br> started to relapse the memories, I actually had so much fun back then with my friends <br> and I enjoy every moments that I had with them.  </td>

    <td>‚ô° I went to SMK Saujana Impian also known as SMKSI from 2017 until 2021. <br> Since my sister went to SMKSI after she graduated, my parents want me to go to the <br> same school as her.<br>‚ô° Since I'm from other school, therefore it is quite hard for me to make a new friends <br> since most of them already had their own group friends. <br> ‚ô° It is very hard for me to adapt with malay school because I realize that the rules are <br> not too strict like chinese schhol. Also, I had a hard time to understand some subject <br> such as math and science since I learn them in chinese back then.<br> ‚ô° I became a class assistant when I was 14, I took my responsibility very serious. I helped <br> every teachers that in need. Sometimes I had to go back home a little late to help my teachers since <br> I was a class assistant. Our class president didn't helped alot therefore, I had to do most of the job. <br>‚ô° I'm taking economic, business and account for my subject elective when I was 16. <br> But I dropped out subject account after a year due to having a hard time to understand the subject.<br> ‚ô° I got 1A, 3B+, 3B- and 1C+ for my SPM result.  </td>

    <td>‚ü° Currently study at UiTM Cawangan Kedah since 2022 until now. <br> This is my first time further my study far away from my family and home. <br> I get homesick for a week after I get into the college. <br> ‚ü° To be honest, I never thought that I'll get into this course since I'm taking <br> business course when I'm in high school. <br> ‚ü° Had a hard time to making new friends because none of friends study here. <br> Thankfully, the friends that I have right now are such an angel. It is a blessing having them. <br> ‚ü° I get to learn alot of new knowledge. For instance, I get to learn how to coding, <br> using adobe, and more. <br> ‚ü° I started to learn to stand outside of my comfort zone slowly, socialize with <br> other people not only my friends. I also learn how to solve my own problems and making <br> my own decision without having my parents beside me. Moreover, I learn to become more <br> independant since my parents used to help me with everything. <br> ‚ü° Since I have one more semester to go until I graduate, I hope that I get to meet <br> new people, and being able to join more programme to become an active <br> students at UiTM Kedah.</td>
